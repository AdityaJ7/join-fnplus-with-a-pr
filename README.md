# FnPlus Community

Our sole mission is to help you recognize your potential :muscle:  and purpose :musical_note:. We believe that everyone has a gift in himself or herself but are not able to see it. We will help you in every possible way. Just ask us! :heart_eyes:

* Help people to reach their full potential
* To create a community where everyone can contribute irrespective of any factor
